:boat: - After explaining and showcasing the concept to the boatcity in Rummelsburg, users were asked to express their feedback and ideas.

When asked about the most desired features:

  >  “I need a display of current ownership and current borrower of a tool.”

  >  “I want to see a list of all tools that are rentable nearby.”

Positive answers about the concept of a digital tool sharing platform:

  >  "All users make sure that they keep good care of the tools, as their reputation is downrated when facilities are returned in bad condition.

  > “We can assure the security of assets/tools & anyone can keep track of the equipment in circulation.”

When asked about the advantages they see when using a tool-sharing app:

 >  “Using the app is cheaper than normal renting from a big hardware store, more convenient and also faster because we keep it local.”

 > “Next to the convenience, we can get to know other craftswo/man around us and can share insights.”

:bulb: - In order to get a better understanding under which circumstances users can benefit from the app, they were asked how they would access a “market” of tool-sharers & in which situations the app can truly help:

What kind of communication devices are you using in your house-boat community?

 >  “at least 80% use a smartphone, there are only some ‘hardliners’ who use simple phones with no internet.”

Use-cases in which the App can be helpful:

 >  "first of all we can finish off daily household works and the repairing of minor incidents.”

 >   “Some people constantly expand their homes on water, making new platforms and the like. With a community of tool-sharers, we can upgrade our floating homes!”

Users were asked to describe a situation in which the tool-sharing app is most useful:

 >   “While planning a new project I need to know what tools are at hand & which others I could rent instead of buying for a single occassion.”

 >   “It is simple: The better the tools, the faster the work is done.”

 >   “Sometimes you have a ‘just-now’ demand, you need something immediately. The app can help me find a instant help.”

What goals are we helping you achieve, and is our app helpful on the way?

 >   “I am building my own ‘home sweet home’ & people opening their tool archive for me, so I can extend my possibilities, is very helpful.”

:wrench: - Next to outlining hopes & advantages, the boat-people tell us what they would like to see improved and implemented for the future. But they also added their concerns about the app.

Within the concept of KiezDAO, which other functions could be added ?

   >  “How about people offer services along with their tools? (man and machine)?”

The community money pool is able to sponsor/crowdfund tools & gadgets which are big or special and can be used by everyone. What comes to mind?

   >  “We could use a small portable generator & some heavy power tools.”

   > “I can imagine a floating workshop with panels and batteries”

People are taking care & think about their privacy & user data storage:

   > “Some things are still not clear to me, how does the locating work? Can anyone see my location ?”

While thinking through all details and functions, some “worst case scenarios” appeared:

   >  “If somebody knows which tools I own, maybe they try to steal them or find another way to track my location and find out where I store my gadgets. This is not what I want.”

   > "Misuse could be a serious threat, e.g. “accidentally” losing tools (also in collaboration with owner, to take funds from the community pool which works as insurance).
