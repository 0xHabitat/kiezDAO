### Tech stack

- Neo4j for off-chain DB
- React (or... maybe Vue) for actual application
- The Graph (subgraph?)
- Celo (stablecoin)

### MVP Testing approach

- Upcoming week get target users to play with figma prototype of the app. Could show them "tech prototype", to make it more-real so blended approach may work.
- Poll to see what features are most important to target users? Good way to test how engaged our users are.
- Consider recording feedback form users using Pepo? 

### Marketing Tests

- Landing page to validate if people interested in idea, host via gitcoin pages. Could A/B test copywriting later, but only worth a bother if sufficient traffic. 
- If previous approach working, consider geo-targeted PPC Campaign. That requires cash so post-hackaton, but we can still do e.g. keyword research for free.
- Contact circular-economy NGOs and similar, to see if we can work out partnerships or otherwise cooperate. 
- Newsletter or medium publication officially announcing the project. Mailing list signups are great to validate initial interest.
