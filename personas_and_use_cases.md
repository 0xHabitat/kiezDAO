### Persona

Intended pilot user of kiezDAO is a boat owner/dweller living in a community of interlinked boats on one of the lakes in vicinity of Berlin. They are often in need of tools used either for maintenance or for leisure activity like e.g. woodwork, DIY or other hobby alas...


### Pain Point

1. Unfortunately since some tools are in short supply yet community is eager to share, if our boater wants to borrow something there is high chance he would need to ask neighbors around if they have a tool, or if they have lent the tool to someone else already. 
2. Likewise, eagerness to share  or other circumstances may lead to boater forgetting **to whom they lent** a tool that they own. 
3. While not a common problem, it would be good to have a way to keep borrower accountable on rare occasion that tool gets damaged or lost. 
4. Newcomer to the community may have problems when it comes to borrowing tools due to lack of trust from long-time members and lack of established reputation.

### Use case

Thusly, we arrive at the use cases, that can be easily generalized to general population: 

1. Listing of tools within community that are available to be rented or shared. 
2. Inventory tracking of borrowed tools. 
3. Collateral or dispute resolution system to have recourse if something goes wrong. 
4. Reputation system.
